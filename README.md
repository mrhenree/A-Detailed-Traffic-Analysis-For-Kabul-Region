## Project brief
The dataset contains information collected over one month period in Kabul, Afghanistan, by a computer vision model. The model detected four classes of vehicles: cars, bikes, buses, and trucks, and stored them in a CSV file. The dataset also includes additional columns such as time in hours, date, days of the week, and counts for each vehicle type (CarCount, BikeCount, BusCount, TruckCount). The "Total" column represents the total count of all vehicle types detected within a 15-minute duration. Additionally, the dataset includes a column indicating the traffic situation categorized into four classes: 1-Heavy, 2-High, 3-Normal, and 4-Low.

For this project, an indepth exploratory analysis was carried out on the dataset, and some useful insights which could be used to manage traffic congestions at different times and days of the week for Kabul region were uncovered. These insights could also be useful in transportation planning, congestion management, and traffic flow analysis. It could be used to understand vehicle demand, identify congestion periods, and inform infrastructure improvements (like lane adjustments). Overall, it could empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, enhance urban mobility, and create efficient and sustainable cities.
